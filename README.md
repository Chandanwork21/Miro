# Miro

I have built a Miro clone using React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Lucide Icons. This collaborative whiteboard application allows users to create, move, and manipulate elements like sticky notes, text, and shapes in a dynamic workspace.

Using Framer Motion, the app delivers smooth animations and drag-and-drop interactions, enhancing the user experience. Tailwind CSS ensures a clean, responsive, and modern UI, making the board visually appealing and easy to use. Lucide Icons add intuitive visual elements for better navigation and usability.

The app supports real-time board interactions, allowing users to position elements freely, resize them, and organize their workflow efficiently. The drag-and-drop feature mimics Miro’s functionality, enabling seamless brainstorming sessions, project planning, and mind mapping.

This project demonstrates React’s component-based architecture for building scalable applications. The use of state management and event handling ensures a smooth and interactive user experience. Future improvements may include real-time collaboration using WebSockets or Firebase, user authentication, and board-saving features.

This Miro clone is an excellent tool for teams and individuals who need an online workspace for creative ideation, planning, and collaboration. It showcases my ability to build interactive and visually engaging applications using modern web technologies.
